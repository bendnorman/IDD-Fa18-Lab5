## Putting it All Together

Include here:
1. Your Arduino code.
```C++
#include <Servo.h> 

#define servoPin  10
#define switchPin 2

#define closePos  0
#define openPos   70

Servo servo;
int switchState;
int previousSwitchState;

// call this when the input on pin 2 changes (LOW to HIGH *or* HIGH to LOW)
void ToggleSwitch(int switchState)
{    
  if (switchState == HIGH)
  {
    servo.write(openPos);
    //Serial.println("switch state is HIGH.  servo.write(openPos) called to open useless box");
  }
  else
  {
    servo.write(closePos);
    //Serial.println("switch state is LOW.   servo.write(closePos) called to close useless box");
  }
  previousSwitchState = switchState;  // remember that the switch state has changed 
}

void setup()
{
  //Serial.begin(9600);
  //Serial.println("Useless Box Lab 5");

  // start with the box closed and the switch in the off postion
  switchState = LOW;
  previousSwitchState = LOW;

  // connect to our servo and make sure it is in the closed position
  servo.attach(servoPin);
  servo.write(closePos);

  // we should probably pay attention to the switch
  pinMode(switchPin, INPUT); 
}

void loop()
{ 
  int switchState = digitalRead(switchPin);
  if (switchState != previousSwitchState)
    ToggleSwitch(switchState);

  delay(20);
}
```
1. `.stl` or `.svg` files for your "bopper" â€” if you use some other technique, include the respective supporting material.

1. At least one photo of your useless box taken in the MakerLab's Portable Photo Studio (or somewhere else, but of similar quality).

1. A video of your useless box in action.

My box was unable to flip the switch.  I think the problem was that my bobber was too long to utilize all of the force of the servo motor.  I should have designed my box so the servo could be mounted on the top so the bobber could be shorter.
